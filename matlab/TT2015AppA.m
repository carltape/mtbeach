% TapeTape2015 "A uniform parameterization of moment tensors"
%
% It may be helpful in understanding the equations within the paper.

% It uses several functions stored within the github project surfacevel2strain:

% TWO OPTIONS to compute Lambda, U, M
if 0==1     % OPTION 1: use existing functions
    % note: U is in south-east-up basis, M is in up-south-east basis
    M0 = 1/sqrt(2);     % to give |Lambda| = 1
    [Muse,Lambda,Useu] = TT2CMT(gamma,delta,M0,kappa,theta,sigma);
    % convert U from south-east-up to north-west-up
    U = convertv(5,3,Useu);
    % convert moment tensor from up-south-east to north-west-up
    M = convert_MT(1,3,Muse);
    
    M = Mvec2Mmat(M,1);

else        % OPTION 2: implement equations from TapeTape2015 directly
    % Eq 7
    R = 1/sqrt(6) * [sqrt(3) 0 -sqrt(3) ; -1 2 -1 ; sqrt(2) sqrt(2) sqrt(2)]';
    sb = sin(beta/deg);
    cb = cos(beta/deg);
    Lambda = R * [ sin(beta/deg)*cos(gamma/deg) sin(beta/deg)*sin(gamma/deg) cos(beta/deg) ]';
    
    % Eq 9-10
    Zsigma = rotmat(sigma,3);
    Xtheta = rotmat(theta,1);
    Zkappa = rotmat(-kappa,3);
    V = Zkappa*Xtheta*Zsigma;
    Yrot = rotmat(-45,2);
    U = V*Yrot;
    
    % Eq 4
    % note: M is a matrix of numbers, NOT a moment tensor with an assumed basis.
    %       But if you want to recover the input values of kappa, sigma,
    %       and theta from M, then M needs to be assumed to have a basis of north-west-up.
    M = U * diag(Lambda) * inv(U);

% Note about moment tensor basis
% The choice of basis will matter when checking the entries in the moment
% tensor. The example calculations in TT2015 and in TT2012beach use north-west-up.
% This is not stated explicitly in TT2015 Appendix A, but here are some passages that do:
%   TT2015, Section S4.2: "(The vector e1 is assumed north and e3 is up.)"
%   TT2015, Figure S3 caption: "If the vector e1 points north and e3 points up,
%           then κ, σ, θ are the strike, slip, and dip angles for
%           one of the two fault planes of [Λ]_VY−π/4 ."
%   TT2012beach, p. 10: "...where the standard basis is e1 (north), e2 (west), e3 (zenith)"
%   TT2012beach, Figure 14.
% see convert_MT.m for referenced publications that use various basis conventions

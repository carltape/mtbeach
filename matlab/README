matlab scripts for manipulating seismic moment tensors

Instructions:
- some of these scripts require rotation-related scripts;
  the path to these scripts can be added by
  a) cloning surfacevel2strain into the same directory as mtbeach
  b) running load_mt.m
- load_mt.m can be called from a startup file such as ~/.matlab/startup.m
- you can check if the paths have been set by typing 'path'
  in the matlab command window
- git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/carltape/surfacevel2strain

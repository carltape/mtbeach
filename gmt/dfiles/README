mtbeach/gmt/dfiles/README

This directory contains published data sets of full moment tensors, as well as some reference files for making lune plots. These files may be useful even if you do not use the perl/GMT script lune.pl.

The files listed below were made by Carl Tape using the matlab script beach_arcs.m,
which is in the mtbeach repository at the relative path ../../matlab/beach_arcs.m

[1] lune points from published data sets

sourcetype_gdvw_xxxx.dat

gdvw = gamma delta v w
xxxx = tag associated with a published study

These files contain lune coordinates (lune longitude, lune latitude) for several published sets of moment tensors. Many of these were plotted in Tape and Tape, "The classical model for moment tensors" (GJI 2013).

These files were made by Carl Tape using a matlab script (FMTdata.m) to read the originally published tables and then convert them to lune coordinates and v-w coordinates.

Tape and Tape (2013) also included some published-but-not-tabulated data sets that are not provided here but were plotted or discussed in that paper; see the bibliography for details.

NOT NEEDED IF $pdir2 IS SET IN lune.pl:
command for Carl:
ln -s /home/carltape/PROJECTS/cmt/figs/bfiles/beachpts_* .

[2] reference files for lune plots (see beach_arcs.m)

[2a] reference lune points and text labels

A typical plot on the lune would include a subset of these points.
The user can choose what type of text label for the reference points.

sourcetype_points_lune.dat
sourcetype_points_rect.dat

columns:
1 gamma or v
2 delta or w
3 text eigenvalue triple (unnormalized eigenvalues)
4 text label
5 justification code
6 text label shift

[2b] reference arcs on the lune (and vw rectangle)

sourcetype_arc_XX.lonlat

XX:
01: deviatoric
02: DC + isotropic (gamma = 0)
03: top-isotropic (lambda3 = 0)
04: bot-isotropic (lambda1 = 0)
05: CDC(nu=1/4)
06: lambda2=0 (nu=0)
07: CDC(nu=0.36)

columns:
1 gamma
2 delta
3 v
4 w

[2c] patches of regions on the lune (and vw rectangle)

These patches can be used to emphasize various regions on the lune (or rectangle).

sourcetype_patch_XX.lonlat

columns:
1 gamma
2 delta
3 v
4 w

[3] sets of reference moment tensors for plotting (psmeca format)

beachballs_iptsZ_irefX_lune_psmeca
beachballs_iptsZ_irefX_vw_psmeca

The Z denotes the set of points on the lune.

Z:
1: regular spacing on the lune (dlon = dlat = 15 deg)
2: the arc for lam2 = 0 (shown in TapeTape2013, Alvizuri2018)

The X denotes the orientation of the reference moment tensor appearing at the center of the lune.

X: strike dip rake fault-type
1:   0 45  90 thrust (T vertical)
2:   0 45 -90 normal (T east)
3:  45 90   0 strike-slip (T east)
4: -45 90   0 strike-slip (T north)
5:  40 50  60 oblique

code from beach_arcs.m:
    % CHOICE OF REFERENCE ORIENTATION 
    if kk==1, str = 0; dip = 45; rk = 90; end
    if kk==2, str = 0; dip = 45; rk = -90; end
    if kk==3, str = 45; dip = 90; rk = 0; end
    if kk==4, str = -45; dip = 90; rk = 0; end
    if kk==5, str = 40; dip = 50; rk = 60; end

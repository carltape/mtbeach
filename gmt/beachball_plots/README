These input files and scripts are designed for testing plotting routines for full moment tensors.

SETUP FROM SCRATCH
git clone https://github.com/carltape/mtbeach.git
cd mtbeach/plot/gmt/beachball_plots/

EXAMPLE 1:
csh -f lune_gmt611.csh
produces the ps file lune_gmt611.ps

For examples 2 and 3, you will need to have the full compearth repository available; or at least have the datafiles present in the directory at ../dfiles/

EXAMPLE 2:
lune_beachballs_gmt6.pl gmt611 --> lune_hammer_iplot2_lplot1_kplot1_gmt611.pdf

In these figures, there are arcs plotted for directions of eigenvalue space where one of the eiganvalues of the moment tensor is zero: lambda3 = 0 (top), lambda2 = 0 (upper left to lower right), and lambda1 = 0 (bottom).

EXAMPLE 3:
uncomment lines 30 and 31 in lune_beachballs_gmt6.pl, then re-run
lune_beachballs_gmt6.pl gmt611 --> lune_ngeo_iplot2_lplot1_kplot1.pdf

EXAMPLE 4:
recomment lines 30 and 31
uncomment out the lines with 'modx', then run:
lune_beachballs_gmt6.pl gmt611_psmeca_flags
This will produce the files
lune_beachballs_gmt611_psmeca_flags.csh
lune_hammer_iplot2_lplot1_kplot1_gmt611_psmeca_flags.pdf

PYGMT

Two examples are also provided as pygmt scripts:
python lune_pygmt.py            --> lune_pygmt.pdf
python lune_beachballs_pygmt.py --> lune_hammer_iplot2_lplot1_kplot1_pygmt.pdf

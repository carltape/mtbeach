system requirements:
Mathematica -- we have tested with 9.0 and 10.0

-----------

Lune.nb
  stand-alone starter notebook for points on the lune
  see Lune.pdf for example output

-----------

ES_ContourPlots.nb
ES_FindSymGroups.nb
  stand-alone notebooks for finding elastic symmetries of an elastic map T

-----------
For other notebooks, you must first open and evaluate these two notebooks, in order:
  common_funs.nb
  common_MTfuns.nb

Then try one of these:

LuneWithOptions.nb
  plotting points on the lune with fancier options

BBs3Dand2D.nb
  plotting moment tensors in 3D (and 2D)

BBsWithOptions.nb
  fancy views of moment tensors, including vector field flow lines

FaultBlockPicture.nb
  plotting a plane, along with a double couple beachball

BrickCode.nb
  fold-up box of strike-dip-rake -- insights for plotting misfit function for DC moment tensors

BBcodeExplanation.nb
  a technical explanation of how the beachballs are plotted
  (not apt to be of interest to most people)

elastic_mapping.nb
  miscellaneous equations in Tape and Tape (2021)

elastic_mapping_XXXX.nb
  examples from Section 15 of Tape and Tape (2021)
  XXXX = mono, orth, tetr, xiso, cube, trig, defeat

elastic_mapping_voigt.nb
  relations between Tbb and Cij Voigt notation (Tape and Tape, 2021, supplement)

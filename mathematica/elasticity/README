system requirements:
Mathematica -- we have tested with 9.0 (2012) and 10.0 (2014), and 13.3 (2023)

These are the two core notebooks and do not require any library notebooks:

ES_ContourPlots.nb
  contour plots on the sphere, showing 2-fold axes [TT2022]
ES_FindSymGroups.nb + ES_FindSymGroups_output.nb
  calculations and lattice diagrams for finding the symmetry group of an elastic map [TT2022]

-----------
This notebook requires first running ES_ContourPlots.nb:

ES_RefMatricesForCollage.nb
   reference elastic maps for figures in TT2022
   (this may take several minutes to run)

-----------
The following notebooks require first running these two notebooks, in order:
  common_funs.nb
  common_MTfuns.nb

elastic_mapping.nb
  miscellaneous equations in TT2021

elastic_mapping_XXXX.nb
  examples from Section 15 of TT2021
  XXXX = mono, orth, tetr, xiso, cube, trig, defeat

elastic_mapping_voigt.nb
  relations between Tbb and Cij voigt notation (TT2021 supplement)

elastic_polyhedra.nb
  figure of 7 polyhedra representing elastic symmetry classes

ES_DerivationOfRefMatrices.nb
  derivation of the reference matrices for elastic symmetry classes

-----------
The following notebooks require first running these notebooks, in order:

ES_FindSymGroups_output.nb
  Sections 2 and 3 of the original notebook -- find symmetry group of a given elastic map

-----------
The following notebooks require first running these notebooks, in order:
